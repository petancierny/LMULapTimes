keep outside wheels inside the white line.\n\n### Turn 3\n- Braking point: Source needed.\n- Turn-in point: Gentle right-hand curve; keep steering smooth to avoid running wide.\n- Apex: Source needed (guide focuses on keeping inside the white line and using the exit kerb).\n\n### Turn 4\n- Braking point: Between the access road and the 100m board (roughly halfway).\n- Turn-in point: Turn in after the 50m board while trail braking.\n- Apex: Lightly touch the inside kerb; the track dips at the apex.\n\n### Turn 5\n- Braking point: Brake after the bollard on the left while downshifting to 3rd.\n- Turn-in point: Source needed (Turn 5 is a kink feeding Turn 6).\n- Apex: Source needed.\n\n### Turn 6\n- Braking point: Same braking phase as Turn 5 (after the bollard).\n- Turn-in point: Once at target speed, turn in toward the inside apex kerb.\n- Apex: Cut the inside kerb while keeping two wheels inside the white line.\n\n### Turn 7\n- Braking point: Source needed (guide notes it can be flat-out with a possible lift).\n- Turn-in point: Source needed (guide stresses the importance of the turn-in point).\n- Apex: Cut inside the kerb to shorten the line and keep inside the white line.\n\n### Turn 8\n- Braking point: Start braking at the beginning of the red/white kerb on the left.\n- Turn-in point: Aim for a mid-to-late apex so you arrive just after the inside bollard.\n- Apex: Mid-to-late apex just after the inside bollard; cut the inside kerb.\n\n### Turn 9\n- Braking point: Begin braking as the red/white kerb starts on the inside.\n- Turn-in point: Just past the crest, about two car lengths before the solid white line.\n- Apex: Stay close to the inside kerb but do not apex it.\n\n### Turn 10\n- Braking point: Continue braking from Turn 9 and finish on the outside.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in earlier than you think after the final downshift to 1st.\n- Apex: Cut the inside kerb without running beyond the red/white kerb.\n\n### Turn 11\n- Braking point: Use the dark blue paint patch on the right (about 60-70m).\n- Turn-in point: After the 50m board while trailing the brakes.\n- Apex: Inside kerb; the guide notes apexing with the outside wheels on the kerb.\n\n### Turn 12\n- Braking point: Source needed (guide describes a flat-out right).\n- Turn-in point: Turn in at the light pole just before the marshal post.\n- Apex: Inside kerb near where the fencing ends on the inside barrier.\n\n### Turn 13\n- Braking point: About four car lengths before the Avis board.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in while trailing the brakes.\n- Apex: Tight to the inside kerb, with throttle before the apex.\n\n### Turn 14\n- Braking point: Just before the 100m board and before the solid white line.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in after the 50m board while trail braking.\n- Apex: Cut the inside kerb, keeping outside wheels just inside the white line.\n\n### Turn 15\n- Braking point: Source needed (continuation of Turn 14 exit).\n- Turn-in point: Let the car run wide and follow the bend back inward.\n- Apex: Source needed.\n\n## Sources\n- https://news.racecontrol.gg/tracks/le-mans-ultimate-bahrain-track-guide/\n", "monza-lmgt3": "# Monza - LMGT3 Track Guide\n\n## Source Coverage\n- Source: RaceControl News Monza track guide (published 2024-11-08)\n- Patch: not stated in source (guide predates LMU v1.2)\n- Track layout: 11 turns\n\n## Turn-by-Turn\n\n### Turn 1\n- Braking point: Just before the 150m board.\n- Turn-in point: Aim for the astroturf patch visible in the braking phase.\n- Apex: Late apex; hug the flat inside kerb and avoid the sausage kerb.\n\n### Turn 2\n- Braking point: A short dab of brake after a small throttle squirt.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in to make the second apex after the dab brake.\n- Apex: Second apex; avoid the inside sausage kerb.\n\n### Turn 3\n- Braking point: Source needed (guide describes it as flat-out).\n- Turn-in point: Smooth steering inputs; stay close to the inside kerb.\n- Apex: Hug the inside kerb through the sweep.\n\n### Turn 4\n- Braking point: Just after the 150m board and the orange block on the armco.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in for a late apex just wide of the orange sausage kerb.\n- Apex: Late apex just wide of the orange sausage kerb; use the striped kerb.\n\n### Turn 5\n- Braking point: Source needed (guide notes you should not need to lift fully).\n- Turn-in point: Stay left on entry to open the second apex.\n- Apex: Second apex; be at least half throttle and avoid the inside sausage kerb.\n\n### Turn 6\n- Braking point: Just before the orange marshal post (about 50m).\n- Turn-in point: Turn in as you pass the marker.\n- Apex: Where the inside armco barrier ends.\n\n### Turn 7\n- Braking point: 50m board.\n- Turn-in point: Source needed.\n- Apex: Mid-to-late apex using the painted part of the kerb.\n\n### Turn 8\n- Braking point: Orange-painted square on the armco;
