Braking point: Brake around the 100m board; hard straight-line braking.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in late with progressive steering.\n- Apex: Late apex on the inside kerb; prioritize exit speed.\n\n### Turn 2\n- Braking point: Flat; use the right side on entry.\n- Turn-in point: Cut the left-hand entry kerb for Eau Rouge.\n- Apex: Inside kerb; keep momentum for the climb.\n\n### Turn 3\n- Braking point: No brake; crest the right-hander with commitment.\n- Turn-in point: Late apex on the right; avoid heavy kerb use.\n- Apex: Light touch of inside kerb; stay settled over the crest.\n\n### Turn 4\n- Braking point: Flat if line is correct.\n- Turn-in point: Blind left over the crest; keep steering straight.\n- Apex: Inside kerb; use exit kerb on the right within limits.\n\n### Turn 5\n- Braking point: Brake around the 100m board; down to 3rd/2nd.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in for the first right of Les Combes.\n- Apex: Climb the entry kerb; avoid being greedy.\n\n### Turn 6\n- Braking point: Release brake early; set up the left.\n- Turn-in point: Use the inside kerb to help rotation.\n- Apex: Inside kerb; keep the car left for the next right.\n\n### Turn 7\n- Braking point: No heavy brake; carry speed.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in early for the right; avoid excess kerb.\n- Apex: Inside kerb; throttle early for the run to Bruxelles.\n\n### Turn 8\n- Braking point: Modulate braking to keep minimum speed up.\n- Turn-in point: Aim for a clean rotation to avoid running wide.\n- Apex: Tight apex; patience before throttle.\n\n### Turn 9\n- Braking point: Lift or light brake from the right side.\n- Turn-in point: Late apex; keep steering input steady.\n- Apex: Inside kerb if stable; power on just before apex.\n\n### Turn 10\n- Braking point: Brake/turn at halfway of the entry kerb; 3rd/4th gear.\n- Turn-in point: Turn in as you brake for Pouhon.\n- Apex: First left apex; keep the car balanced.\n\n### Turn 11\n- Braking point: Carry speed; commitment required.\n- Turn-in point: Second left of Pouhon; smooth inputs.\n- Apex: Second apex; build throttle on exit.\n\n### Turn 12\n- Braking point: Source needed.\n- Turn-in point: Source needed.\n- Apex: Source needed.\n\n### Turn 13\n- Braking point: Source needed.\n- Turn-in point: Source needed.\n- Apex: Source needed.\n\n### Turn 14\n- Braking point: Brake at the start of the left entry kerb; down to

just before the kerb ends for Paul Frere.\n- Apex: Use all exit for the run to Blanchimont.\n\n### Turn 16\n- Braking point: Flat; position to the right on entry.\n- Turn-in point: Late apex for Blanchimont; smooth steering.\n- Apex: Avoid heavy inside kerb use; keep speed high.\n\n### Turn 17\n- Braking point: Flat; no brake.\n- Turn-in point: Hold the line through the fast left.\n- Apex: Inside kerb if safe; use exit within limits.\n\n### Turn 18\n- Braking point: Source needed.\n- Turn-in point: Source needed.\n- Apex: Source needed.\n\n### Turn 19\n- Braking point: Source needed.\n- Turn-in point: Source needed.\n- Apex: Source needed.\n\n## Sources\n- https://news.racecontrol.gg/tracks/le-mans-ultimate-spa-francorchamps-circuit-guide/\n-
